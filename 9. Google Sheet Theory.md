# Google Sheets Theory

## Section One - Spreadsheet Basics, Variables, and Shortcuts!
Spreadsheet Basics, Variables, and Shortcuts: This section covers fundamental spreadsheet operations like data entry, formatting, and utilizing keyboard shortcuts for efficiency. It introduces variables for data manipulation.
### Example:
Enter sales data into cells A1:A5, format it using bold text, and utilize shortcuts like Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V for quick copying and pasting.

## Section Two - Introduction to Your First Functions!
Introduction to Your First Functions: This section acquaints you with basic spreadsheet functions like SUM, AVERAGE, MAX, and MIN, enabling efficient data analysis. You'll understand how to compose and implement these functions effectively to streamline calculations.
### Example:
To calculate the total sales for a month, input sales figures into cells A1 to A30 and use the SUM function as "=SUM(A1:A30)" in cell B1 to obtain the sum.

## Section Three - Introduction to Conditional Functions
Introduction to Conditional Functions: This section delves into conditional functions such as IF statements, facilitating decision-making based on specified conditions. You'll explore logical functions like AND, OR, and NOT for more intricate conditional operations.
### Example:
Employ the IF function to determine if sales exceed a target. For instance, "=IF(A1>B1, "Met", "Not Met")" checks if the value in cell A1 (sales) exceeds the target value in cell B1, returning "Met" if true and "Not Met" if false.

## Section Four - Sorting, Filtering & Pivot Tables Crash Course
Sorting, Filtering & Pivot Tables Crash Course: This section provides a comprehensive overview of sorting, filtering, and pivot table creation. You'll learn to organize and analyze data efficiently through these powerful features.
### Example:
To sort a list of names alphabetically, select the range of cells containing the names and click on the "Sort A-Z" button in the toolbar.

## Section Five - Lookups Discover the power of lookup functions in spreadsheets
Lookups: Explore lookup functions like VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP to retrieve specific data from tables. Learn how to search vertically or horizontally and fetch corresponding values efficiently.
### Example:
Utilize the VLOOKUP function to find the price of a product based on its code. For instance, "=VLOOKUP(A2, B2:D10, 3, FALSE)" searches for the code in cell A2 within the table range B2:D10 and returns the corresponding price from the third column.

## Section Six - GOOGLE Functions Explore advanced functions and features available in Google Sheets
GOOGLE Functions: This section unveils advanced features unique to Google Sheets, such as GOOGLEFINANCE for real-time financial data, GOOGLE TRANSLATE for language translation, and GOOGLE MAPS for geographical data visualization.
### Example:
Employ the GOOGLE FINANCE function to retrieve the current stock price of Google. For instance, "=GOOGLE FINANCE("GOOG", "price")" fetches the current stock price of Google (GOOG).

## Section Seven - Import Range Data create an Excel format
Import Range Data and Create an Excel Format: This section covers importing and formatting data from various sources into a spreadsheet, ensuring compatibility with Excel. Learn techniques to organize and enhance imported data effectively.
### Example:
Use "=IMPORTDATA("https://example.com/data.csv")" to import data from a CSV file online. Then, format the imported data using tools like text-to-columns and conditional formatting for improved readability.
