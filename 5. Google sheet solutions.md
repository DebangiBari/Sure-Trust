### Analysis of Customer Data

1. **Churn Rate:**
   - Formula: `Churn Rate = (COUNTIF(O1:O1030, "1") / COUNTIF(P1:P1030,"1")) * 100`

2. **Gender Distribution:**
   - Male Customers: `COUNTIF(F1:F1029, "Male")`
   - Female Customers: `COUNTIF(F1:F1030, "Female")`

3. **Number of Active Customers:**
   - Formula: `Active Customers = COUNTIF(O1:O1030, "0")`

4. **Number of Customers Churned:**
   - Formula: `Churned Customers = COUNTIF(O1:O1030, "1")`

5. **Percentage of Customers Using Credit Card:**
   - Formula: `Percentage of Credit Card Users = (COUNTIF(L1:L1030, "1") / COUNTIF(K1:K1030,"1")) * 100`

6. **Age Group with Highest Churn Rate:**
   - Age Group 0-20: `COUNTIFS(G1:G1030, ">=00", G1:G1030, "<=20")`
   - Age Group 21-40: `COUNTIFS(G1:G1030, ">=21", G1:G1030, "<=40")`
   - Age Group 41-60: `COUNTIFS(G1:G1030, ">=41", G1:G1030, "<=60")`
   - Age Group 61-80: `COUNTIFS(G1:G1030, ">=41", G1:G1030, "<=80")`
   - Age Group 81-100: `COUNTIFS(G1:G1030, ">=81", G1:G1030, "<=100")`

7. **Gender Distribution Among Churned Customers:**
   - Male Customers Churned: `COUNTIFS(F1:F1030, "Male", O1:O1030, "1")`
   - Female Customers Churned: `COUNTIFS(F1:F1030, "Female", O1:O1030, "1")`

8. **Geographic Distribution of Customers:**
   - Unique Countries: `UNIQUE(E1:E1030)`
   - Count of Customers in France: `COUNTIF(E1:E1030, "France")`
   - Count of Customers in Spain: `COUNTIF(E1:E1030, "Spain")`
   - Count of Customers in Germany: `COUNTIF(E1:E1030, "Germany")`
