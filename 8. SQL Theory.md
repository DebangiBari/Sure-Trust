# SQL Theory Summary

## SQL Essentials
SQL enables users to interact with relational databases, performing tasks like querying data with SELECT and modifying data with commands like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

### Basic Syntax
SQL statements typically follow the structure:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Sales';

Data Definition Language (DDL)
DDL is used to define, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, and constraints.
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

Data Manipulation Language (DML)
DML is used to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data in a database.
INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES ('john_doe', 'john@example.com');

Data Query Language (DQL)
DQL is used to retrieve information from the database.
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 30;

Constraints
Constraints are rules enforced on data columns to maintain integrity and accuracy of the data.
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    age INT CHECK (age >= 18)
);

Functions and Aggregates
Functions manipulate data values while aggregates perform calculations on sets of values.
SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;

Views
Views are virtual tables generated by queries, enabling simplified access to complex data.
CREATE VIEW high_salary_employees AS SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;

Stored Procedures and Functions
Stored Procedures and Functions are named sets of SQL statements that can be invoked repeatedly to perform specific tasks.
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeByID(IN emp_id INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id = emp_id;
END;

Indexes and Performance Optimization
Indexes are data structures used to improve the speed of data retrieval operations on database tables.
CREATE INDEX idx_last_name ON employees (last_name);

Transactions and Concurrency Control
Transactions ensure the integrity of data by grouping SQL operations, while concurrency control manages simultaneous access to data by multiple users to prevent conflicts.
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 123;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 456;
COMMIT;

Security
Security in databases involves controlling access, encrypting sensitive data, and preventing unauthorized operations to protect against breaches.
GRANT SELECT ON employees TO user1;

Advanced SQL Features
Advanced SQL features include window functions for complex analytical queries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for recursive or modular queries.
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, 
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
FROM employees;
