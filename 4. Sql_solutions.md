        WHEN exited = '1' THEN 1 
        ELSE 0 
    END) AS churned_customers,
    COUNT(*) AS total_customers,
    (SUM(CASE 
        WHEN exited = '1' THEN 1

    END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS churn_rate
FROM 
    churn_model;

    (SUM(CASE WHEN exited = '1' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS churn_rate
FROM 
    (
    SELECT

            WHEN age BETWEEN 18 AND 25 THEN '18-25'
            WHEN age BETWEEN 26 AND 35 THEN '26-35'
            WHEN age BETWEEN 36 AND 45 THEN '36-45'
